        <h2>General Requirements:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A. Each shipment to the United States must consist of high-quality
            goods and be properly preserved according to the (customary)
            commercial practices. Live pests are not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            B. Cashew nuts must be packed in new, clean, dry, leak-proof
            containers without lead or internal lining paper. The packaging must
            ensure the integrity of the goods during transportation and normal
            storage. The outside of the containers must be wrapped in new
            cartons, free from insects or mold, and sealed without the use of
            staples, except as required by the ultimate consumer. The carton
            must undergo a minimum 200-pound, 32 ECT strength test. The CO2 gas
            used must be suitable for food.
          </li>
          <li>
            C. Only authorized pesticides for cashew nuts should be used, and
            the residue level of pesticides must comply with the regulations of
            the importing country's government. No residue of any unauthorized
            pesticide is allowed to be present on cashew nuts imported into the
            country. In the United States, only approved pesticides can be used
            for cashew nuts, and the residue limits for these pesticides are as
            follows: Flutriafol - 0.02 ppm, phosphine - 0.1 ppm. Methyl bromide
            and napthalene fumigation are prohibited.

                the carton, according to the laws of the destination country.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            E. The bill of lading must list the number of cartons, country of
            origin, and the markings on the cartons.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            I. Block packing is not allowed: Block packing is defined as cashew
            nuts in vacuum bags that are packed together so tightly that they
            cannot be separated without the use of external tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            J. Cashew kernels must be free from hard, sharp, and hairy foreign
            materials.

        <h2>QUALITY AND CLASSIFICATION:</h2>
        <p>Cashew kernels are classified as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - First Quality Fancy: Cashew kernels are uniformly colored, which
            can be white, pale yellow, or pale ivory.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Second Quality Scorched: Cashew kernels can be yellow, light
            brown, pale ivory, light gray, or ivory darkened.

            light brown, pale ivory, light gray, or ivory darkened.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Lightly Blemished Wholes (LBW): Kernels may be light brown, pale
            ivory, light gray, or ivory darkened. Kernels may have light brown
            spots or blemishes on the surface, as long as no more than 40% of
            the kernel is affected.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Blemished Whole (BW): Kernels can be deep yellow, brown, amber,
            light or dark green. Kernels may be slightly wrinkled, immature, or
            have light brown spots or blemishes on the surface, as long as no
            more than 60% of the kernel is affected.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Third Quality Special Scorched: Cashew kernels can be deep yellow,
            brown, amber, or light to dark green. Kernels may be slightly
            wrinkled, immature, have light brown spots or blemishes, or other
            discoloration.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Fourth Quality: Cashew kernels similar to first or second quality,
            but allowed to have some specks.
          </li>

        <h2>Appendix II - Testing for Roasted Kernels</h2>
        <p>
          In the United States, most cashew nuts sold to US consumers are in the
          roasted form. The external appearance of the roasted kernel is the
          factor for consumer acceptability. An uneven color result is never
          appealing to consumers. Therefore, it is recommended that exporters
          roast cashew nut samples prior to packaging to evaluate the external
          color of the roasted kernels. This is a simple practice but yields
          good results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Testing roasted kernels is done to determine the accurate grade of the
          lot, and thus it will be sold as Grade 1, Grade 2, or Grade 3 quality.

          Method - AFI for determining insect infestation, serious damage,
          grading, and moisture
        </h3>
        <p>Method - AFI for insect infestation and serious damage:</p>
        <p>
          Determine the presence of live or dead insects by sieving the entire
          sample taken from the carton through a No. 14 sieve. Determine
          internal or external damage caused by insects through random sampling
          and general analysis. Calculate the percentage of serious damage by
          counting the damaged kernels for whole kernels and by weight for
          broken kernels. To perform a general analysis, the minimum sample size
          to be tested is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For average samples: a minimum of 250 kernels for whole kernels and
            250 grams for broken kernels. If the percentage of insect-damaged
            kernels is greater than 0.5%, an additional sample should be tested
            (250 kernels for whole kernels and 250 grams for broken kernels).
          </li>
          <li>
            For analysis samples: a minimum of 100 kernels for whole kernels and
            100 grams for broken kernels.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method - AFI for grading:</p>
        <p>
          Assuming the samples collected from a lot are representative and
          visually similar, the samples are thoroughly mixed for grading (both
          raw and roasted samples).
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of broken kernels, defects in 500 grams of
          sample, and calculate the percentage by weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of smaller and larger size kernels in 500
          grams for whole kernels and calculate the percentage by weight.
        </p>
        <p>Determine the count per pound (454 grams) for whole kernels.</p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of broken pieces using calibrated sieves.
          Sieve 250 grams of sample for 2 minutes using a shaker machine.
          Calculate the percentage of sieved pieces by weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine defects after roasting in a 500-gram sample and calculate
          the percentage by weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cashew kernels with off-flavors and rancidity must be evaluated by a
          sensory panel. The loss of flavor is caused by spoilage, fermentation,
          activity of microorganisms, insect infestation, or chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Color analysis must be performed under fluorescent lighting with a
          color rendering index (CRI) not less than CRI91.
        </p>
        <h3>Sensory testing for raw kernels</h3>
        <p>
          Taste testing is conducted on the analyzed sample to detect the
          presence of Chlorophenothane and Chlorpyriphos. The testing is done by
          tasting 1 kernel from each random sample and determining the presence
          or absence of the flavor.
        </p>
        <h3>Insect infestation testing</h3>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of insect-infested kernels for each test
          sample by sieving 100 kernels for whole kernels and 100 grams for
          broken kernels. Use a No. 20 (giant) sieve to remove smaller
          cockroaches under 2.5 mm.
        </p>
        <h3>Moisture testing</h3>
        <p>
          To determine relative humidity, we use 1 kernel from each sample
          (maximum of 100 kernels per day) until a sufficient number (50-100
          kernels) is obtained. Additionally, measure the absolute moisture
          content of 10 samples (if available) using an absolute moisture meter.

          exceeds 1%). The oil is heated to a temperature of 300 - 310°F (149 -
          154°C) and maintained at that temperature during roasting. The cashew
          nuts are fully immersed in the oil for 3 minutes. If roasting at a
          lower temperature, the roasting time may be extended. The temperature
          can be adjusted when roasting split, endosperm, and broken kernels.

        <h3>Defects in roasted kernels</h3>
        <p>
          Spotted - Brown spots appearing on the surface of the roasted cashew
          kernel that were not present in the raw kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scorched tip - Darker color at the tip of the kernel compared to other
          areas due to oil frying or shell detachment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Color variation - Any color variation other than spotting that makes
          the color of the cashew kernel appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dark roast - Cashew kernels with a light to medium brown color in the
          roasted sample, making the color of the roasted sample appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep roast - Cashew kernels with a dark brown color present in the
          roasted sample, making the color of the roasted sample appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrapes - Scraped markings larger than 5mm in diameter, appearing
          brighter on the surface of the cashew kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uneven roast - A batch of roasted cashew nuts with more than 7% of the
          total defects including spotting, scorched tip, color variation, dark
          roast, deep roast, and scrapes. The roasted sample is also considered
          uneven if it has more than 10% scrapes or a combined total of 15%
          defects.

        <p>
          In the United States, most cashew nuts sold to U.S. consumers are in
          the form of roasted kernels: the external appearance of roasted
          kernels is a factor in evaluating consumer acceptability. An uneven
          color result is never appealing to consumers. Therefore, it is
          recommended that exporters roast cashew samples before packaging to

        </h3>
        <p>Method - AFI for insect infestation and serious damage:</p>
        <p>
          Determine live or dead insects by passing the entire sample taken from
          the carton through a No. 14 sieve. Determine internal or external
          damage by taking random subsamples and conducting a general analysis.
          Calculate the percentage of serious damage by counting kernels for
          whole kernels and by weight for broken kernels. For the general
          analysis, the minimum sample size to be tested shall be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For average samples: the minimum determination is 250 kernels for
            whole kernels and 250 grams for broken kernels. If the percentage of
            damaged kernels by insects is greater than 0.5%, an additional
            sample shall be determined (250 kernels for whole kernels and 250
            grams for broken kernels).
          </li>
          <li>
            For analytical samples: the minimum determination is 100 kernels for
            whole kernels and 100 grams for broken kernels.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method - AFI for grading:</p>
        <p>
          Assuming that samples collected from a lot are reasonable and visually
          similar, samples are thoroughly mixed to determine grading (for both
          raw and roasted samples).
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of broken kernels, defects in 500 grams of
          sample, and calculate the percentage by weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of smaller and larger size in 500 grams for
          whole kernels and calculate the percentage by weight.
        </p>
        <p>Determine the count per pound (454 grams) for whole kernels.</p>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of broken pieces with calibrated specialty

        <p>
          Samples with off-odors and rancidity must be evaluated by a sensory
          panel. This loss of flavor results from rancidity, fermentation,
          microbial activity, insect infestation, or chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Color analysis should be conducted under fluorescent lights with a
          color rendering index (CRI) not less than CRI91.
        </p>
        <h3>Sensory testing for raw kernels</h3>
        <p>
          Tasting tests are performed on the analytical sample to detect the
          presence of Chlorophenothane and Chlorpyriphos. The test involves
          tasting 1 kernel from each random sample and determining the presence
          or absence of this flavor.
        </p>
        <h3>Insect infestation testing</h3>
        <p>
          Determine the percentage of insect infestation for each test sample by
          sieving 100 kernels for whole kernels and 100 grams for broken
          kernels. Use a No. 20 (jumbo) sieve to remove small insects less than
          2.5 mm.
        </p>
        <h3>Moisture testing</h3>
        <p>
          To determine the relative humidity, 1 kernel is used from each sample
          (up to 100 kernels/day) until a sufficient number (50-100 kernels) is
          obtained. At the same time, absolute moisture content of 10 samples
          (if available) is measured using an absolute moisture meter.

        </p>
        <p>
          Cashew kernels are roasted in pure vegetable oil, possibly peanut oil,
          which can be reused until it starts to decompose (when its free fatty
          acid exceeds 1%). The oil is heated to a temperature of 300 – 310°F
          (149 – 154°C) and maintained at that heat, and the kernels are
          immersed in the oil for a duration of 3 minutes. If roasting at a
          lower temperature, the roasting time may be longer than 3 minutes. The
          temperature may be adjusted when roasting broken, split, and small
          pieces.
        </p>
        <h3>Defects in roasted kernels</h3>
        <p>
          Spotted – Brown spots appearing on the surface of roasted kernels that
          were not present in the raw kernels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scorched tip – A darker color at the tip of the kernel compared to
          other areas due to the frying or shell detachment process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Color variation – Any color variation other than spotting that makes
          the color of the kernel appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dark roast – Kernels that have a medium brown color in the roasted
          sample and make the color of the roasted sample appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep roast – Kernels that have a dark brown color present in the
          roasted sample and make the color of the roasted sample appear uneven.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrapes – Scrapes with a diameter greater than 5mm, appearing lighter
          on the surface of the kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uneven roast – A batch is considered uneven if it has more than 7% of
          the total following defects: spotted, scorched tip, color variation,
          dark roast, deep roast, and scrapes. A roasted sample is also
          considered uneven if it has more than 10% of scrapes or 15% when
          combined with other defects.

          Table 1. Allowable limits for defects and damage of cashew kernels
        </h3>
        <p>
          This table presents the maximum limits for defects and damage of
          cashew kernels. Testing must comply with the requirements of this
          limit table, and the sampling method will be introduced in Appendix I
          and used for analysis. The allowable limits of the lower grade include
          those defined for the lower grade but not the total defects of that
          lower grade. The percentages stated here are based on weight.

          accepted if it has equivalent or better quality than the sample
          inspected prior to shipment. Two samples must be taken prior to
          shipment, sealed, and sent to the buyer for acceptance, with one
          sealed sample reserved for dispute resolution in arbitration.
